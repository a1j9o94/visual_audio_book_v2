# Visual Audio Books

Visual Audio Books is an innovative platform that transforms public domain books into immersive audiovisual experiences. It combines AI-generated audio narration with contextually relevant images to create a unique "visual audiobook" experience, similar to a TikTok-style feed for literature.

## Features

- üìö Access to public domain books from Project Gutenberg
- üéß AI-powered text-to-speech narration
- üñºÔ∏è AI-generated images that match the story context
- üì± TikTok-style vertical scrolling interface
- üîñ Bookmark and track reading progress
- üë• Character tracking and scene analysis
- üìä Reading statistics and preferences

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Backend**: tRPC, Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
  - Storing audio and images directly may need to consider saving in a storage service like UploadThing or S3 later
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **AI Services**:
  - OpenAI API for text-to-speech
  - Stability AI for image generation
  - Anthropic Claude for scene analysis
- **Job Processing**: BullMQ + Redis
