Design Document for Visual Audio Books
Objective
Visual Audio Books aims to make public domain books come alive by combining AI-narrated audio with AI-generated visuals in a TikTok-inspired vertical scrolling interface. The design should be immersive, intuitive, and consistent across mobile and desktop, enhancing the user experience by focusing on ease of reading, listening, and navigation.

Key Design Goals
Immersive Experience: Visuals and audio should transport users into the story with minimal distractions.
Simple Navigation: A TikTok-style vertical scroll for mobile and a comparable desktop layout.
Engagement Features: Clear, accessible bookmarking, progress tracking, and character insights.
Consistent Aesthetic: Dark theme with subtle gradients; avoid harsh contrast shifts.
Responsive Layouts: Fully responsive and seamless across desktop and mobile.
UI Components

Header:
Elements: App logo, navigation links, search, profile dropdown.
Placement: Sticky header to remain visible during scrolling.

Minimum Requirements and Tech Considerations
Responsive Sizing & Scaling

Behavior: Maintain fluid layouts, especially for image display on mobile.
Scrolling: Implement a seamless vertical scroll with lightweight transitions and smooth image/audio load.
Audio Playback Controls

Behavior: Hide default audio player UI, substituting with custom, intuitive controls.
Background Gradients & Fills

Behavior: Full-screen gradient fill; prevent scrolling issues where dragging reveals a white background.
CSS: Update background CSS to ensure container fills and fits across screen sizes.
Cross-Device Compatibility

Test across Android, iOS, and major desktop browsers to ensure consistent experience.
